<h2>Poker Hand Evaluator</h2>
Assumptions/caveats:
<ul>
<li> No jokers/wild cards </li>
<li> Five card hands are used</li>
<li> With manual entry there aren't checks that the deck is legal (e.g. there are only 4 of each card, 1 for each suit)
<li> Full support for kicker card tie breaking only currently implemented for two-pair </li>
